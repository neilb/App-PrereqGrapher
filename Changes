    - Don't write to STDERR unless verbose option was given
    - Now used different filenames for each test, maybe that's
      causing the fails ...

    - Changed the test filenames to fit in 8.3, in case that's
      why my Win32 tests are failing...

0.08 2014-02-01
    - After creating files in testsuite, chmod 0600 them before unlinking.
