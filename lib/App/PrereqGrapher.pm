=head1 NAME

App::PrereqGrapher - generate dependency graph using Perl::PrereqScanner

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use App::PrereqGrapher;
  
  my %options = (
                          format => 'dot',
                         no_core => 0,
                 no_recurse_core => 1,
                     output_file => 'prereqs.dot',
                         verbose => 0,
                );
  my $grapher = App::PrereqGrapher->new( %options );
  
  $grapher->generate_graph('Module::Path');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PrereqGrapher builds a directed graph of the prereqs or dependencies for
a file or module. It uses Perl::PrereqScanner to find the dependencies for the seed,
and then repeatedly calls Perl::PrereqScanner on those dependencies, and so on,
until all dependencies have been found.

It then saves the resulting graph to a file, using one of the five supported formats.
The default format is 'dot', the format used by the GraphViz graph drawing toolkit.

If your code contains lines like:

 require 5.006;
 use 5.006;

Then you'll end up with a dependency labelled B<perl 5.006>;
this way you can see where you're dependent on modules which
require different minimum versions of perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor understands the following options:

=over 4

=item format

Select the output format, which must be one of: dot, svg, vcg, gml, or html.
See L</"OUTPUT FORMATS"> for more about the supported output formats.
If not specified, the default format is 'dot'.

=item output_file

Specifies the name of the file to write the dependency graph into,
including the extension. If not specified, the filename will be C<dependencies>,
with the extension set according to the format.

=item depth

Only generate the graph to the specified depth.
If the complete dependency graph is very large, this option may help you get
an overview.

=item no_core

Don't include any modules which are core (included with perl) for the version
of perl being used.

=item no_recurse_core

When a core module is used, include it in the dependency graph,
but don't show any of I<its> dependencies.

=item timeout

Specifies the timeout for Graph::Easy when its laying out the graph.
This is mainly relevant for formats like SVG and HTML, where the graph
layout is done in Perl. Defaults to 5 seconds.

=item verbose

Display verbose logging as the grapher runs.
Currently this will just tell you if a module was use'd or require'd,
but couldn't be found locally.

=back

=head2 generate_graph

Takes one or more seed items. Each item may be a module or the path to a perl file.

  $grapher->generate_graph('Module::Path', 'Module::Version');

It will first try and interpret each item as a module, but if it can't find a module
with the given name, it will try and interpret it as a file path.
This means that if you have a file called C<strict> for example, then you won't be
able to run:

  $grapher->generate_graph('strict');

as it will be interpreted as the module of that name. Put an explicit path to stop this:

  $grapher->generate_graph('./strict');

=head1 OUTPUT FORMATS

=over 4

=item dot

The format used by GraphViz and related tools.

=item svg

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) a W3C standard.
You have to install L<Graph::Easy::As_svg> if you want to use this format.

=item vcg

The VCG or GDL format.

=item gml

Graph Markup Language, aka GraphML.

=item html

Generate an HTML format with embedded CSS. I haven't been able to get this to work,
but it's one of the formats supported by L<Graph::Easy>.

=back

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

L<Perl::PrereqScanner> uses L<PPI> to parse each item.
PPI has a hard-coded limit for the size of file it's prepared to parse
(currently just over 1M).
This means that very large files will be ignored;
for example Perl::Tidy cannot be graphed,
and if you try and graph a file that use's Perl::Tidy,
then it just won't appear in the graph.

If a class isn't defined in its own file,
then App::PrereqGrapher won't find it;
for example Tie::StdHash is defined inside Tie::Hash.
By default these are silently ignored,
but if you use the B<-verbose> option you'll get the following warning:

  can't find Tie::StdHash - keeping calm and carrying on.

Perl::PrereqScanner parses code and makes no attempt to
determine whether any of it would actually run on your platform.
For example, one module might decide at run-time whether to C<require>
Foo::Bar or Foo::Baz, and might never use Foo::Baz on your OS.
But Perl::PrereqScanner will see both of Foo::Bar and Foo::Baz
as pre-reqs.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Have an option to control what depth we should recurse to?
You might only be interested in the dependencies of your code,
and their first level of dependencies.

=item *

Show some indication that we're running. It can take a long time to run
if your ultimate dependency graph is very large.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The distribution for this module contains a command-line script,
L<prereq-grapher>. It has its own documentation.

This module uses L<Perl::PrereqScanner> to parse the source code,
and L<Graph::Easy> to generate and save the dependency graph.
